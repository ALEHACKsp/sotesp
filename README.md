### Status

As far as I've experienced this is undetected. At the time of writing this, Sea of Thieves doesn't have any official anti-cheat software to worry about.

### Building

For your convenience; pre-built dependencies and a competent compiler can be found in my personal [development environment](https://gitlab.com/codegoose/devutil).
